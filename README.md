Cursor pagination in Django REST Framework uses cursor-based pagination to efficiently navigate large datasets without loading all pages. Cursors represent a specific location in the dataset, allowing clients to easily navigate results and handle changes to the dataset.

Cursor Pagination is a type of pagination in Django REST Framework that uses cursor-based pagination to efficiently navigate through paginated results. Cursor pagination is particularly useful for large datasets because it doesn't require the client to load all the pages in order to jump to a specific page. Instead, it uses cursors, which are opaque tokens representing a specific location in the dataset, to paginate through results.

Here's an example of how to implement cursor pagination in Django REST Framework:

1. Add 'rest_framework.pagination.CursorPagination' to your DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS in settings.py:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {

    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.CursorPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10
    
}

2. In your view, set the pagination_class attribute to CursorPagination.
3. In your serializer, set the ordering attribute to a list of fields to be used for pagination.
4. In your request, include the cursor query parameter.

Note that cursor pagination requires a field for ordering the results and that field must be unique. In the example above, the created_at field is used for ordering the results, but you should choose a field that is appropriate for your data model.

Overall, cursor pagination is a useful technique for paginating through large datasets efficiently. It allows clients to navigate through paginated results easily without having to load all pages, and it scales well with large datasets.
